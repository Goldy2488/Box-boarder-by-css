# Box Animation

This is a simple HTML and CSS project that demonstrates two types of box animations:

1. Horizontal Movement Animation: A red box moves horizontally back and forth across the screen.
2. Diagonal Line Animation: A diagonal line is drawn across a box, creating a dynamic visual effect.
